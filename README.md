# DSDE1-Computing 1 example Assessment instructions
This is an open book/computer/internet assessment. You are allowed to refer to your own notes, previous code, and search online. You are NOT allowed to receive or ask for assistance from any individual such as a fellow classmate or anyone else during the assessment. You may NOT share your code with anyone else until all students have completed the assessment and submission has closed.

The code will be evaluated, not only on the basis of how it works but also on how clearly it is commented and and readable it is.

## How to Complete the Assessment

1. Clone this repository on your own computer.

2. Commit your answers and push them to your repo on Github. You can (and are encouraged) to do this continuously as you work on the questions.

3. Ensure that you are correctly pushing your changes to the repo by checking on Github for your additions.

4. Your final answers must be pushed by the deadline at @@:@@ (3 hours after the timed start) unless you have been explicitly been allowed extended time as a reasonable adjustment as recommended by the Disability Advisory Services (students for which this applies have been contacted). Any pushed commits after this time will not be considered for marks and may have the Git penalty described below applied, if git has not been used correctly (e.g. the Github upload button is used instead).


## Assessment Questions
### Using Git

1. Clone this repository on your computer (do not clone it within an existing repository such as the weekly exercises or the practice assessment). Edit the file `Informations.txt` to include your name, CID, and account names.    *[0 point]*

__NOTE__: If you do not use git to push your code to the correct repository within the allotted assessment time, you will have a penalty of 10% applied to your overall score.


### Structure of the assessment:

The questions are located into three subfolders:

1. Class question: write and implement a class with its own methods (50 points overall);
2. General programming question: write 8 functions (40 points overall);
3. Plot question: generate the correct plot by extracting the correct data from a file (10 points overall).

In each folder you will find the python files (.py) that you need to work on for the exam.


## Marking Rubric

Detailed marking rubrics can be seen directly in the Python files for each question. Note the above mentioned penalty of 10% for not pushing to the correct repository within the time limit.


## DISCLAIMER

Notice that the topics in this example do not cover the whole course. In the final exam the questions might be slightly different (although the structure will remain the same).
