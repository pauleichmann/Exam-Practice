See the README for the full description of the desired plot.


TOTAL POINTS AVAILABLE: 10 

10 points - desired plot is generated and code is efficient 

6-9 points - desired plot is generated, but code could be 
improved (e.g., the students used unnecessary if statements)

4-6 points - plot is generated but it has some errors

1-4 points - no plot is generated, but some effort was made to generate one

0 points - no effort made to answer question





'''
# Write a Python script that reads in the text file `data.txt`, in the folder Data, and generates 
# one plot as shown in image.png
# 
# Read the text file (hint: the delimiter in the 
# file is `','`) and notice that there are 9 columns. The first column represents the time of the 
# measurement, whereas the other columns represent data collected 
# at that specific time. To get maximum marks you need to be sure that the code you write can be executed on a computer different than yours (meaning, do not use
# absolute paths when opening and closing directories).
# 
# - Plot the data contained in the 6th column against the data contained in the 1st column (i.e., 
#   data in the 6th column on the y axis, data in the 1st column on the x axis). 
# - Plot the data contained in the 3rd column against the data contained in the 1st column (i.e., 
#   data in the 3rd column on the y axis, data in the 1st column on the x axis). 
# - Add an xlabel as "Time [s]" and a ylabel as "Speed [m/s]"
